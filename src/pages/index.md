# Hi, I'm Nicolas Toffolo

After working for 7 years as a translator in the subtitling industry, I changed my career path to head towards IT. I started studying Industrial IT at <strong class="text-[#008080]"><abbr title="Haute Ã‰cole Louvain en Hainaut">HELHa</abbr> Charleroi</strong> in September 2020 and got my degree *summa cum laude* in June 2023.

What started as a curiosity about IT quickly became a passion. The three-year bachelor's degree I undertook was a very comprehensive introduction to all aspects of the IT world. At the moment, I am most passionate about **web development**, both front and back end. 

In both private life and work, I love acquiring new skills and always stay up to date with emerging trends. I am excited to leverage my expertise to help people achieve their goals. I take pride in being part of a community that strives to make a positive impact on the world by continuously pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
