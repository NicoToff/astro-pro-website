# Astro

For smaller, content-oriented projects, Next.js feels a bit like bringing a bazooka to a knife fight. Astro is the perfect alternative for that. It offers just the right amount of abstraction and flexibility to build a static website with a modern toolkit.

To me, what makes Astro stand out is its inexistent cost of entry for any web developer. If you're a beginner in frontend and barely know any JavaScript, you can still transition to Astro to start enjoying the component architecture. If you're a seasoned developer, you can use your favorite libraries and frameworks.

Astro shines in terms of performance, as it does everything to serve as much static HTML as possible, but it also allows the use of <abbr title="server-side rendering">SSR</abbr> when you need it. 

For a rather recent project, I'm very impressed with Astro and can't wait to see how it evolves.
