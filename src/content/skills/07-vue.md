I was introduced to Vue.js in September 2023 when I joined the team at Emakina to work on the frontend of [visit.brussels](https://www.visit.brussels/en/visitors). I very quickly fell in love with Vue 3's architecture. It closely follows web standards for its templating, there is clean and understandable `setup` before a component is instantiated, its hooks (called "composables") don't try to constantly shoot you in the foot... wait, it's a bit too good to be true, right? Well, no:
- Its composation API works great
- Reactivity is explicit and performant
- There is a great balance between framing the code and leaving some freedom
- Its Typescript integration is perfect
- It's not reinventing the wheel every three months
- It's a mature product (started in 2014 by Evan You) 
- It has its own fullstack framework with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- It has great editor tooling
- The learning curve is smooth
- The docs are pretty good

I think we've got ourselves a pretty amazing JS framework, folks!
