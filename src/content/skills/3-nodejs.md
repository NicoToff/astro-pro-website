# Node.js

I'm pretty good at node.js. I've been using it for a while now, and I've been teaching it for a while now. It is also the main technology I use for my projects.

Node is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
