# TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

## JavaScript and More

TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

### A Result You Can Trust

TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.
