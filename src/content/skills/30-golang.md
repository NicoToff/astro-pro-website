Golang has a simply beauty to it that simply can't be ignored. With a heavy inspiration on the simplicity of C (a no-nonsense syntax) and the reliability of a garbage-collected language, Golang strikes an incredible balance.

I've started learning bits of Go here and there when I have time for it, and that feels like a breath of fresh air away from the cluttered JS syntax and ecosystem. You can do everything in Go, but there are rarely two ways to do something... and that's so great. Code becomes streamlined, logic is expectable, and OH MY GOD error as values are so much better than `try {} catch {}`.

I wish Go was more popular in Europe, because that would kick some serious Java a**.
