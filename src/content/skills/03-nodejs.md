I love how much the Node.js ecosystem has to offer. It feels like the pinnacle of what the <abbr title="Free open-source software">FOSS</abbr> community can create.

[Well actually](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/021/665/DpQ9YJl.png), with its non-blocking event-loop based I/O model and Google's V8 engine under the hood, Node.js is a runtime that offers plenty of performance for many workloads, and [it keeps getting better](https://blog.rafaelgss.dev/state-of-nodejs-performance-2023).

There is no denying compiled languages will always have an edge in terms of performance, but handling concurrency is not something every language does well. [Many big companies](https://relevant.software/blog/big-companies-that-use-node-js-and-why-they-do-that/) have adopted Node.js for some part of their backend. Also, there simply are times where the tradeoff between raw power and productivity is a fantastic deal.

Sure, node.js isn't perfect, but it keeps improving and even on areas where maintainers are stubborn (e.g. no TS support), they get challenged by the competition (Deno and Bun) to reconsider their stance. So, long live node.js!
