> An interpreted language can't be more performant than an interpreted one! You can't even do multithreading in JavaScript!

-- <cite>Every C# and Java developer</cite>

[Well actually](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/021/665/DpQ9YJl.png), with its non-blocking event-loop based I/O model and Google's V8 engine under the hood, Node.js is a runtime that offers plenty of performance, and [it keeps getting better](https://blog.rafaelgss.dev/state-of-nodejs-performance-2023).

There is no denying compiled languages will always have an edge in terms of performance. Still [many big companies](https://relevant.software/blog/big-companies-that-use-node-js-and-why-they-do-that/) have adopted Node.js for some part of their backend. There simply are times where the trade between raw power and productivity is a fantastic deal.

I just love how much the Node.js ecosystem has to offer. It feels like the pinnacle of what the <abbr title="Free open-source software">FOSS</abbr> community has to offer.
