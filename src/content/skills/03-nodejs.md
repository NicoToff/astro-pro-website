## Node.js

> An interpreted language can't be more performant than an interpreted one! You can't even do multithreading in JavaScript! -- 

-- <cite>Every C# and Java developer</cite>

[Well actually](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/021/665/DpQ9YJl.png), with its non-blocking event-loop based I/O model and Google's V8 engine under the hood, Node.js is a runtime that offers plenty of performance, and [it keeps getting better](https://blog.rafaelgss.dev/state-of-nodejs-performance-2023).

[Many big companies](https://relevant.software/blog/big-companies-that-use-node-js-and-why-they-do-that/) have adopted it for some part of their backend.

I just love how rich and bustling the Node.js ecosystem is. It feels like the pinnacle of what the <abbr title="Free open-source software">FOSS</abbr> community has to offer. Also, there is scientific evidence that JavaScript is the superior language, as demonstrated by [Atwood's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Jeff%20Atwood%20made,eventually%20be%20written%20in%20JavaScript.%E2%80%9D).

> Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.
