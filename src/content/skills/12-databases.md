The sweet pleasure of data storage, hmmm. It is an acquired taste to enjoy and discuss various database paradigms. SQL is ancient, but robust. NoSQL is modern, but flexible. Relations are important for consistency and structure, but documents are just good enough sometimes. Then, why not have relations between documents? And what are graph databases? And vectors? Yup, you've got yourself a good ol' bottomless pit right there.

So far, I have had the privilege to work with MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Of course, for testing purposes, I have also used SQLite.
