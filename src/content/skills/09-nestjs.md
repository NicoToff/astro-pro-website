title: NestJS
---

In the competitive JS game, people are running out of names for their projects. Between Next, Nest, Nuxt, knowing what's what is a skill in itself.

NestJS is a backend node.js framework that tries to streamline the architecture of server applications. Its approach is heavily inspired by Angular, which happens to be a great fit for backend.

I discovered NestJS when working with [Vendure](https://www.vendure.io) at [Mirahi](https://mirahi.io). All its principles were very new and confusing to me: decorators, modules, services, dependency injection, factories... and an OOP approach in JS!? After some time, NestJS started to grow on me and I actually love it to build APIs.
