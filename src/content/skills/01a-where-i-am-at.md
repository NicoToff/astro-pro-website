title: Where I am at
---

Among the numerous tasks involved in creating a web experience, I am comfortable with both front and back end development, and I can also deploy and maintain a web application. Here is a scientifically accurate representation of my current skills (higher means better):

Since I love both front and back end development, don't be afraid, you can call me with this fancy term: **full stack developer**.
