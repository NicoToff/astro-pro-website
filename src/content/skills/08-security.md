No matter what you do in IT, you can't avoid thinking about security. Call me crazy, but I love to think about how to break things and how to protect them. Input validation, rate limiting, authentication, getting environment variable safe... these are all things that I had to think about when creating my latest NestJS REST API.

Cybersecurity is an incredibly vast field, but I find it essential to know enough so that I can make informed decisions when designing an application.
