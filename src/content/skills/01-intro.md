title: A passion for learning
---

Over the past three years, I've been diving into the world of IT, exploring everything from programming and networking to electronics and cybersecurity. Looking back, I'm proud of the knowledge I manage to acquire and the challenges I've overcome.

I have this belief that as long as I keep at it, there's nothing I can't learn eventually. Learning is like putting a puzzle together â€“ each piece adds to the bigger picture, and with time on my side, any puzzle can be solved.

As you will see, most of my knowledge is centered around web technologies. I'm absolutely fascinated by the internet and the possibilities it offers in terms of communication, open-source software, teaching, entertainment, and so much more.
