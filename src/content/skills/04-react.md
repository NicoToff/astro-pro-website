After a few small website projects using plain HTML, then EJS as templating and Express as backend, I felt the need to learn a more modern, component-oriented approach. I chose React for this first introduction, which I found very compelling due to its ability to be used in both web and mobile development. 

> **Fun fact:** As of 2025, I still have not touched React Native... but someday, surely!

React isn't the most beloved UI framework these days, but it is here to stay, for better or worse. I can just say I love React's flexibility and the community around it that built countless amazing tools... Which also means there is a minefield of terrible React libraries out there.
