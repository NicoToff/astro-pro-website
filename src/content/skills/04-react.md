After a few small website projects using plain HTML, then EJS and Express, I felt the need to learn a more modern and structured approach. I went for React, the cool kid on the block, which I found very compelling due to its ability to be used in both web and mobile development.

Let's not enter into a framework warfare, I'll just say I love React's flexibility and the community around it that built countless amazing tools.

For the web, it just feels a bit tricky to implement SSR, routing, handle requests... Ah, if only there was...
