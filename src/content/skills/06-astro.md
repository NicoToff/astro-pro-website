Astro.js is a static-first web framework that relies on Vite for bundling and strives to provide amazing DX. 

Astro stands out thanks to its non-existent cost of entry for any web developer. If you're a beginner in frontend and barely know any JavaScript, you can still transition to Astro to start enjoying the component architecture thanks to Astro's very own JSX-based templating language. If you're a seasoned developer, you can build a static website in a matter of hours while using your favorite libraries for highly interactive content.

As of April 2025, Astro has become a reasonable alternative to the established leaders on the competitive fullstack JS framework market. It's getting new features at the speed of light and the developer experience has never been so juicy.
