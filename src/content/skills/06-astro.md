For smaller, content-oriented projects, Next.js feels a bit like bringing a bazooka to a knife fight. Astro is the perfect alternative for that. It offers just the right amount of abstraction and flexibility to build a static website with a modern toolkit.

To me, Astro stands thanks to its inexistent cost of entry for any web developer. If you're a beginner in frontend and barely know any JavaScript, you can still transition to Astro to start enjoying the component architecture. If you're a seasoned developer, you can build a static website in a matter of ours and use your favorite libraries and frameworks for dynamic content.

As of September 2024, Astro has become a reasonable alternative to the established leaders on the fullstack JS framework market. It's getting new features at the speed of light and the developer experience has never been so juicy. Astro can also boast itself to be the first JS framework [to integrate a DB](https://astro.build/db/)! (yeah yeah, long live PHP and all that...)
