I have ~worked with~ suffered the most expensive Adobe product there is to date. People call it the "Rolls Royce" of web stacks. I didn't know Rolls Royce was making a car with a deprecated Java version, built on top a Frankenstein of purchased open-source projects, hosting it on an unreliable cloud environment, with zero tooling, atrocious DX and a customer service on life support.

Adobe Experience Manager may have been impressive a decade ago, but it has failed to keep up with modern web development. Its outdated and cumbersome architecture destroy developer productivity, making every routine task unnecessarily complex. Despite its enormous cost, AEM barely delivers what a contemporary digital project requires.

I believe the only reason AEM stays somewhat popular is the twisted ability of sales people to sell things they know nothing about.

> **Fun fact:** AEM is stuck on Java 11, which [saw its EOL in September 2023](https://endoflife.date/oracle-jdk). Big companies like Adobe are the reason why Oracle is forced to maintain insanely long extended support

If anything useful, AEM taught me resilience... and gave me the absolute certainty that I shall forever run far away from any project involving an Adobe product.
