Among the numerous tasks involved in creating a web experience, I am comfortable with both frontend and backend development, and I can also deploy and maintain a web application. Here is a scientifically accurate representation of my current skills (higher means better):

<Image src={image} alt="Integretion: 3, Web pages: 4, App Logic: 5, Data fetching: 4, Database: 2, Deployment: 2" width="1000" height="300" />

Since I love both front and backend development, don't be afraid, you can call me with this fancy term: **full stack developer**.
