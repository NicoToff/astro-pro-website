## Docker

Containerisation is a great way to make sure your application runs the same way on every machine.

I am no DevOps expert, but I can make a few Dockerfiles here and there. Many platforms make it very easy to deploy anything as long as you have a Docker image to provide, so it is always nice to know a bit about it.
