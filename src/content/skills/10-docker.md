Containerization is invaluable for ensuring consistent deployment across different environments. It guarantees that the software runs identically on every machine, from development to production. I like surprises, but not when someone in the room says "it works on my machine".

While I wouldn't consider myself a DevOps expert, I've gained proficiency in creating Dockerfiles, notably for my latest NestJS projects. I also have experience with Docker Compose, which I use to run my local development environment.
