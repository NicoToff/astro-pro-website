When you work with web technologies, there is no avoiding JavaScript. Such a sweet and easy language, everybody loves it! Then, you build a medium scale-project and you cry tears of blood because it is a wonderful mess. Plus, there is scientific evidence that JavaScript is a contagious disease, as demonstrated by [Atwood's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Jeff%20Atwood%20made,eventually%20be%20written%20in%20JavaScript.%E2%80%9D).

> Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.

It is no surprise that TypeScript has become an industry standard for projects of any size these days. As developers, we are all masochists for sure, but no one wants to be a martyr.

I have been using TypeScript for a few years now, and I love what it allowed me to build.
