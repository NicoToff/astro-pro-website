When you work with web technologies, there is no avoiding JavaScript. Such a sweet and easy language, everybody loves it! Then, you build a medium-scale project and any file more than a week old is basically legacy code that can't be touched without breaking the whole system.

There is scientific evidence that JavaScript is a contagious disease, as demonstrated by [Atwood's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Jeff%20Atwood%20made,eventually%20be%20written%20in%20JavaScript.%E2%80%9D).

> Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.

In short, this is no surprise that TypeScript has become an industry standard for projects of any size these days. As developers, we are all masochists for sure, but no one wants to be a martyr.

I have been using TypeScript for a few years now, and I'm very happy with what it allowed me to build.
