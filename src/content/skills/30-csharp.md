# C#

Monopolies are bad, Microsoft is mean! Yes, but how good are the open-source product they make? Turns out, pretty nice: VSCode, TypeScript, .NET Core... And it's been a while since I wanted to know more about the .NET ecosystem, so I decided to learn C#.

Syntactically, it's very similar to TypeScript, and conceptually, it's akin to Java, so I feel very much at home here. I'm currently getting accustomed with the language and I'm looking forward to building a new projects with it.
