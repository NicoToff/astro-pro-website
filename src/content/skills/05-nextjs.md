# Next.js

Ah, Next.js the missing piece to make for a great DX! I love how it takes care of all the boring stuff to let you concentrate on what matters: building a great web experience. I'm also a big fan of the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/overview) platform, which makes it trivial to deploy and manage web applications.
