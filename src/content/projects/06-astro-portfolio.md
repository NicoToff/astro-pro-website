# Astro Portfolio Website

> Yes, I'm talking about this website!

## Context

Back in June 2022, I built a rudimentary portfolio website using Express.js, EJS and Bootstrap. It was a great learning experience, but the hosting provider I used (Heroku) stopped being free for its Hobby tier. As any reasonable developer would do, I refused to pay a single dime, let my account die and rebuilt the entire thing using Astro in August 2023. Apart from a few minor bugs in dev environment, using Astro was an absolute pleasure.

## Tasks

- Learn how Astro components work
- Learn how to use React component with Astro
- Create a simple design using Tailwind
- Enjoy the battle-tested components built by [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Organise all the content to be handled in markdown files
- Use dynamic routing to create a dedicated page for some content
