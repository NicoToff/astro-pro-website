# HELHa Révision

## Context

My first pet project in IT was the development of a static website to share summaries with my fellow students. Despite its simplicity, it did the job! I learned a ton about HTML5 and CSS3 over the months I was building this project. For a time, I prefered using CSS libraries like Bootstrap, because they allow for clean design without much effort and knowledge of CSS. Today, I'm a big fan of Tailwind.

HELHa-Révision received updates until March 2021, at which point the amount of work for school made it impossible to continue this project. With my most recent knowledge, I realise I could have built a static website, organised my summaries in markdown collections and used a static site generator like Hugo, Gatsby... or now Astro!

This website is ugly, ill-designed, but I am proud of what I achieved with this first project. This project taught me that you learn best by building, most of all how painful it is to work without modern tools (I was using Notepad++, ffs).

## Accomplishments

- Create CSS classes tailored to my needs
- Integrate my summaries as raw HTML content
