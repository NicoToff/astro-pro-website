# HELHa Révision

## Context

My first pet project in IT was the development of a static website to share summaries with my fellow students. Despite its simplicity, it did the job! I learned a ton about HTML5 and CSS3 over the months I was building this project. For a time, I prefered using CSS libraries like Bootstrap, because they allow for clean design without much effort and knowledge of CSS. Today, I'm a big fan of Tailwind.

HELHa-Révision received updates until March 2021, at which point the amount of work for school made it impossible to continue this project. With my more current knowledge, I realise I could have made a static website, organise my summaries in markdown collections and use a static site generator like Hugo, Gatsby... or now Astro!

This website is ugly, ill-designed, but I am proud of what I achieved. This project taught me a lot about web development, most of all how painful it is to work without modern tools (I was using Notepad++, ffs).

## Tasks

- Create CSS classes tailored to my needs
- Integrate my summaries as HTML content
