## Context

During the summer 2022, the Quality Department at my school (HELHa) needed a convenient web tool to browse and display data collected from yearly surveys. Before this tool, analysing data for a given year was tedious at best, and it was completely impossible to compare results over time. The hardest part of this project was to create a usable relational schema to store the data.
