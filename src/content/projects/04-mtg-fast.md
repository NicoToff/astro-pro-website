# _Magic: the Gathering_, blazingly fast

## Context

Many great tools already exist for browsing the _Magic: the Gathering_ card collection (around 30,000 cards). However, none of them offered the features I was looking for, including search-as-you-type capabilities, typo tolerance, specific advanced search fields, and accurate European pricing information. With my newly acquired web development skills, I started building a web experience that solved my problems.

## Accomplishments

- Adapt an existing e-commerce template to my specific needs
- Integrate Typesense as a search engine
- Design an optimized document schema to serve the card objects
- Acquire and update card pricing (available publicly) from reputable websites
- Deploy and maintain the project
