# A Vendure prototype

## Context

Mirahi, a web agency in Brussels, needed to assess the viability of Vendure, a NestJS-based e-commerce framework, to deal with food products orders. I was tasked with creating a fullstack proof of concept using modern headless technologies.

## Tasks

- Create a Vendure plugin (NestJS module) to use Adyen as a payment provider
- Wireframe, then build a storefront using Next.js and Tailwind
- Set up the Vendure GraphQL API to connect the storefront and server
- Adapt Vendure to deal with food products
- Handle state from the backend with React Query
- Improve accessibility on the storefront with Radix UI (shadcn components)
