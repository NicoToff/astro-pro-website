# Dragons Home

My latest pet project <3

## Context

As a veteran game master, I've become quite opinionated about what I like and dislike in tabletop roleplaying games. My game of choice remains Dungeons & Dragons, but there are a whole slew of rules I can't suffer to play with. Over the years, I've tweaked the game system to my own liking.

My initial idea for Dragons Home was to build a website with a bunch of homebrew rules that my friends and I could have an easy access to... But why stop there?

Dragons Home has become a full-fledged game system, forked from the SRD 5.1 (used to build D&D 5e). The website contains all the resources you need to build your own games with this soon-to-be open-sourced game system.
