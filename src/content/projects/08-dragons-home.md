# Dragons Home

My latest pet project <3

## Context

My initial idea was to build a website with a bunch of homebrew rules that my friends and I were using in our D&D 5e games. But why stop there?

Dragons Home has become a full-fledged game system, forked from the SRD 5.1 (used to build D&D 5e). The website contains all the resources you need to build your own games with this soon-to-be open-sourced game system.

## Accomplishments

- Build a large scale Astro project
- Handle all content creation
- Maintain all aspects of this complex project
