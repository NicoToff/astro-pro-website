I've been playing TRPGs since I'm a teenager. The game system is unimportant, whether it is [Dungeons &amp; Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/) or [ICRPG](https://hankerinferinale.wixsite.com/icrpg), the essence of TRPGs lies in sheer creativity and storytelling. My friends and I have conjured up countless tales and universes over the years. You'd think people can get tired of gathering around a table to make up stories with one another, but apart from a few breaks, I've never become bored of being a dungeon master.
