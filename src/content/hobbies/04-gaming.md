Ever since I was a kid, I've been playing video games. My favourite genres are RTS, RPG, adventure and sandbox games, but I can enjoy any great title â€“ for example, I hate rogue-like games, but loved [Hades](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades_(video_game)>) thanks to its incredible story and replayability.

Having fallen to greed, the video game industry is not really going in the right direction these past years, but there are still some gems to be found (love you [Larian Studios](https://larian.com/)!).
