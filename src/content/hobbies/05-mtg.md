Released in 1993, *Magic: the Gathering* has likely been the most influential trading card game of all time. I started playing it in my teens and have been hooked ever since. The sheer depth of the game is staggering, allowing for deckbuilding in a ton of different formats for endless replayability. I used to be a tournament judge for the game and traveled internationally to Grand Prix and Pro Tour events. Now, *Magic* is just one of my many hobbies that I enjoy the most with my friends.
