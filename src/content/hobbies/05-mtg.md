Released in 1993, _Magic: the Gathering_ has likely been the most influential trading card game of all time. The sheer depth of the game is staggering, allowing for deckbuilding in a ton of different formats which has kept me engaged in one way or another for over 15 years.

I used to be a tournament judge for the game and traveled internationally to Grand Prix and Pro Tour events. Now, _Magic_ is just one of my many hobbies that I enjoy the most with my friends.
