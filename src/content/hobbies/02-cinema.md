# Movies and series

There is a reason why my initial career was in subtitling: I have a passion for cinema. When I was young, I felt frustrated that I couldn't watch all the movies I wanted. VHS tapes were expensive, and going to the theater was impractical. I couldn't have been happier when the internet revolutionized entertainment, making movies and series increasingly accessible through streaming services.

I can genuinely appreciate any genre, provided the movie boasts a compelling storyline and captivating cinematography. Among my favorite directors, listed in no particular order, are Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, George Lucas, J.J. Abrams, Matt Groening, Robert Rodriguez, James Cameron, and the Wachowskis.
